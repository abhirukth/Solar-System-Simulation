# Solar-System-Simulation


Solar-System-Simulation
THIS IS THE BEGINNER LEVEL IN GAME DESIGNING AND DEVELOPMENT.

This application is the basic implementation of Unity engine using C#. This is a simple simulation of our solar system which includes -

SUN ROTATING AROUND ITS AXIS
ALL PLANETS REVOLVING AROUND THE SUN AND ROTATING AROUND THEIR AXES
A SINGLE MOON OF THE EARTH REVOLVING AROUND EARTH
COMETS PASSING BY RANDOMLY SPAWNING AND GETTING DESTROYED AFTER A WHILE
LIGHTINGS, BACKGROUND, CAMERA, SECONDARY CAMERA AT THE LEFT BOTTOM, SOUND EFFECTS
TRAILING PATH LIGHT SHOWING FOR ALL PLANETS
BY CLICKING ON ANY OBJECT, THE CAMERA SHIFTS TO VIEW FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE
What can you do?

ADD MORE OBJECTS LIKE ASTEROIDS ROAMING HERE N THERE
ASTEROID BELT AROUND JUPITER
RINGS OF SATURN
OTHER PROMINENT MOONS OF OTHER PLANETS
ADD SOME EXCITING FEATURES, LIKE WHEN YOU CLICK ON ANY OBJECT A BRIEF THEORY AND HISTORY ABOUT THEM APPEARS WRITTEN IN A BOX
SPLASH SCREEN...etc
SO, YOU CAN LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN LOOSE AND JUST PLAY WITH IT...ENJOY!
